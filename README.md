Open Layers Plot Direction and Magnitude with WebGL

This repo is for me to explore openlayers by representing direction & magnitude in a meaningful way on a map using WebGL .

I aim to render **WIND CURRENTS** from a data file on an OpenLayers 7.1.0 map. Each feature should be styled as an arrow with the COLOR and SIZE adjusted based on the strength of the current. There are 3 levels of magnitude (low, medium, high) as proof of concept.

# How to run
- git clone 
- npm install
- npm start

# The Data 
/data/weather.json is faked weather data across the globe. Each feature has a coordinates, wind speed & wind direction included.

# Other Stuff
This project was inspired by various Openlayers examples (https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/).
